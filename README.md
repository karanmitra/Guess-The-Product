# Guess-The-Product

### A huge challenge is faced by manufacturing companies in classifying the raw materials(products) received from vendors. Help them to classify the products by building a machine learning model that could predict the product category based on certain features.

The following description of every column in the dataset.

- Inv_id:	An invoice ID is a number generated after every successful checkout by a buyer.
- Vendor_Code:	Vendor code is the Vendor name that is used during the creation of the Product Order.
- GL_Code:	General ledger (GL) code, is a number used to record business transactions in the general ledger.
- Inv_Amt:	The Invoice amount is the amount of the bill. the amount stated in the bill is called the invoice amount.
- Item_Description:	Brief description of the item.
- Product_Category:	Class to which the product belongs.

I have done the following activities:
  a.	Exploratory Data Analysis of variables
  b.	ML model
  c.	Model Evaluation
  d.	Code to generate submission.csv
